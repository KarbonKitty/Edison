# Edison

Simple incremental game made as a learning experience in client-side Blazor.

### How to build and run locally

You will need .NET 5 CLI.

Run `dotnet run` in the cloned folder to run the game locally. You can use `dotnet watch run` to watch for changes and recompile as they happen.

Run `dotnet build -c Release` to build release version of the game, which is significantly smaller and faster then debug build you get from `dotnet run`.
